## Expected Results

Based on our fixes and previous tests:

### Success Rate Predictions

| Category | Expected | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Complete Success** | 60-70% | Form filled AND confirmed |
| **Filled Only** | 10-20% | Form filled, unclear confirmation |
| **Failed to Fill** | 5-10% | Form detected but couldn't fill |
| **No Contact Page** | 5-10% | No forms on site |
| **Timeout/Errors** | 5-10% | Slow sites or technical issues |

### Overall Expected

- **12-14/20** (60-70%) - Complete success with confirmation
- **14-16/20** (70-80%) - Form filled (may not have clear confirmation)
- **17-18/20** (85-90%) - Contact page detected

## Success Criteria

✅ **Excellent**: 14+ complete successes (70%+)
✅ **Good**: 12-13 complete successes (60-65%)
✅ **Acceptable**: 10-11 complete successes (50-55%)

## What Each Status Means

### ✅ `success`
- Form filled with all fields
- Submit button clicked
- Confirmation message detected ("Thank you", "Success", etc.)
- **This is the goal!**

### ⚠️ `filled_only`
- Form filled successfully
- Submit button clicked
- No clear confirmation (but likely worked)
- **Usually successful, just no feedback**

### ❌ `failed_to_fill`
- Form detected (score 40%+)
- Could not fill required fields
- Complex form structure or unusual field names

### 📄 `no_contact_page`
- No contact form found on site
- Data quality issue with dealership website

### ⏱️ `timeout`
- Site too slow to load
- Server not responding

### 📉 `low_score`
- Form detected but score < 40%
- Low confidence, skipped

## Monitoring Progress

Check the output directory while running:

```bash
# List test directories (most recent first)
ls -lt tests/ | grep submission_test

# Check latest results
tail -20 tests/submission_test_20_dealers_*/results.csv

# Count successes so far
grep "success" tests/submission_test_20_dealers_*/results.csv | wc -l
```

## After Test Completes

### 1. Review Summary
```bash
cat tests/submission_test_20_dealers_*/SUMMARY.md
```

### 2. Check Screenshots
Look at before/after screenshots to visually verify submissions

### 3. Analyze Results
```bash
# Open results in spreadsheet
open tests/submission_test_20_dealers_*/results.csv
```

## Key Metrics to Track

1. **Complete Success Rate** - Forms filled AND confirmed
2. **Fill Rate** - Forms successfully filled (regardless of confirmation)
3. **Detection Rate** - Contact pages successfully found
4. **Error Rate** - Technical failures or bugs
5. **Average Time** - Processing time per dealership

## Improvements from Fixes

This test validates all 10 critical fixes:

1. ✅ **No bot detection** - Removed GPU/images flags
2. ✅ **Fast execution** - Smart waiting instead of delays
3. ✅ **Best forms** - Selects highest scoring forms
4. ✅ **No crashes** - Mouse position bug fixed
5. ✅ **Retry logic** - Cache allows retries
6. ✅ **Circular redirect** - Detected and handled
7. ✅ **Error recovery** - Timeouts handled gracefully
8. ✅ **Form deduplication** - Fuzzy matching works
9. ✅ **CSV validation** - Valid dealerships only
10. ✅ **Distance sorting** - Closest first (frontend)

## Next Steps After Test

1. **Review results** - Check success rate
2. **Verify submissions** - Look at screenshots
3. **Analyze failures** - Understand what went wrong
4. **Fine-tune** - Adjust timeouts or field detection if needed
5. **Scale up** - If 60%+ success, ready for production!

## Estimated Time

- **Per dealership**: 30-60 seconds
- **Total for 20**: 10-20 minutes
- **With browser visible**: Slower but educational to watch
